# Password Generator
#### By Carlos Aguirre Oseguera

## Generating a custom password
[TRY IT HERE!](https://ca2los.github.io/password/)
*v.1.0*

The user will be able to create a password by clicking a button, and the action will execute the program. The project
will prompt options for the user to select and customize the password:

    * Quantity of digits (Between 8 and 128 digits)
    * Lowercase characters (Optional)   
    * Uppercase characters (Optional)
    * Numbers (Optional)
    * Symbols (Optional)

### YOU WILL FIND:
This project is intended to demonstrate the possibilities of JavaScript for generating a custom password. [Take 
a look at the script.js](https://github.com/ca2los/password/blob/main/js/script.js), and you will find the highlights of the program.

- [x] Functions
- [x] If Statements 
- [x] For Loops
- [x] Prompts
- [x] Alerts
- [x] REGEX to validate characters
- [x] Reloads
- [x] Validations

### NEXT IMPROVEMENTS:
I tried to improvise the experience by solving specific situations, and somehow I did it. The problem is that I couldn't
stabilize the behavior of the program, so in order to bring you the best possible version, all the extra code is in
comments and might helps you understand what I'm thinking of:

- [ ] Avoid all letters, symbols and numbers but YES and Y in the Prompts
- [ ] Reduce the steps in the program and make it more efficient
- [ ] Fully understand .reload() in JS
